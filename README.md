# Arcade game

## How to run the game

Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/zymeth25/arcade-game.git
```
Then open the `arcade-game` directory and run `index.html` using your favorite web browser.

## How to play

Your objective is to reach the water without touching (or being eaten by) any bugs. Use keyboard arrows to move
between squares. Green grassy fields are a safe zone, bugs will not spawn there.

### Score system

Every time you reach the water your score is incremented by 1 and your position is reset.
Be careful though, if you run into one of the bugs your position is also reset but so is your score!
